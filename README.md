# Palindrome Partition - C++ Project

The Palindrome Partition project in C++ is an implementation of two algorithms to partition a given string into palindromic substrings. The project demonstrates the brute force approach and the dynamic programming approach to achieve this task efficiently.

## Features

- Brute Force Algorithm: The project includes the implementation of the brute force approach to partition a string into palindromic substrings.
- Dynamic Programming Algorithm: The project also includes the implementation of the dynamic programming approach, which utilizes memoization to optimize the partition process.
- Input Validation: The program validates the input string, ensuring it is non-empty and contains valid characters.
- Output Visualization: The project displays the generated palindromic partitions, showcasing the substrings that form the palindrome.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later).
- Development environment or command-line tools to compile and run the C++ code.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/your-username/palindrome-partition-cpp).
2. Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment.
3. Build the project using the C++ compiler or IDE of your choice.

## Usage

1. Run the compiled executable of the project.
2. Enter a string to be partitioned into palindromic substrings.
3. The program will display the generated palindromic partitions.
4. Analyze the results and observe the palindromic substrings formed.
